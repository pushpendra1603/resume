    I am Software Engineer who likes problem solving, programming languages, databases, AI and learning new things in general. I like to dabble in solving problems in Haskell, Rust and read books like SICP, DDIA, clean code, etc. 
    Few of my guilty pleasures are reading books(Academic/LightNovels/Wuxia/Manga), watching Anime, TV-Shows, and just browsing YouTube.
